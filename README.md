# hello-world
an age old programming exercise that's typically the introduction to all coding endeavors. excited to begin this journey!
my name is naomi and i've been learning to code for a while now but without any particular end goal in mind. i have found this approach to be quite unsatisfactory and frustrating. i'm now just delving into the world of code again and this time hoping and working for better results to my pursuits! i'm also a student of computer science at college and this is quite the impetus to get good at coding and find that it doesn't have to be drab or annoying!
